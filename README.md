# EDA_Project
## *This was an Exploratory Data Analysis project for TripleTen. 👩🏽‍💻*
This project analyzes Instacart's 2017 data to uncover customer shopping habits and patterns. Findings reveal that customers primarily order fresh food, such as produce and dairy, with a strong preference for organic items. Most orders are small (1-5 items), but reorders make up 90% of each order on average. These insights can guide Instacart in optimizing advertising campaigns and customer retention strategies, such as promoting frequently reordered items or offering targeted discounts to re-engage inactive customers.
